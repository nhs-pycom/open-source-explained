# What is open-source

**1.1.1** Open source is the practice of publishing the source code of a software project so that anyone can read, modify, re-use, and improve that software. 

# Use of open-source in the NHS

**2.1.1** Programmers across the NHS frequently use existing open source packages and modules in their work, especially for routine data analysis or processing, or for mobile development (as part of the NHS App, for instance).

## The growth in open-source

**2.2.1** The ‘cambrian explosion’ visualisation captures the rise in open-source software in recent years.
