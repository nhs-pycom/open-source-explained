# What is open-source

- 1.1.1 Open-source is the practice of publishing the source code of a software project so that anyone can read, modify, re-use, and improve that software.
- 1.1.2 With open-source we can adapt and improve the best technology the world has to offer and bring it to the NHS.

# Use of open-source in the NHS

- 2.1.1 Programmers across the NHS frequently use existing open source packages and modules in their work, especially for routine data analysis or processing, or for mobile development (as part of the NHS App, for instance).

## The growth in open-source use

# Benefits to the NHS

- 3.1.1 As set out in the NHS Digital Service Manual, public services are built with public money–so unless there’s a good reason not to (security for example), all code produced by the NHS should be made publicly available.
- 3.1.2 Quote "Open source means that the NHS can give our work back to the people who fund it, the public: allowing them to more easily join our staff, more quickly develop products and SMEs to support us, and better understand and trust the work we do on their behalf." NHS Open-source Policy
- 3.1.3 To this end, the Department of Health & Social Care has made a commitment to make all new NHS code open source and published under open licences which define the legal terms for free access and reuse.
