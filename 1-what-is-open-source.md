# What is open-source

- 1.1.1 Open-source is the practice of publishing the source code of a software project so that anyone can read, modify, re-use, and improve that software.
- 1.1.2 With open-source we can adapt and improve the best technology the world has to offer and bring it to the NHS.
- 1.1.3 Opening our work, means that we can also give it back to the people who fund it, the public. Allowing them to better understand and trust the work we do on their behalf.
- The Department of Health & Social Care has made a commitment to make all new NHS code open-source and published under open licences which define the legal terms for free access and reuse.

# Use of open-source in the NHS

- 2.1.1 Programmers across the NHS frequently use existing open source packages and modules in their work, especially for routine data analysis or processing, or for mobile development (as part of the NHS App, for instance).

## The growth in open-source use

- 2.2.1 The ‘cambrian explosion’ visualisation captures the rise in open-source software in recent years.

- 2.2.2 From the first open-source repo published by NHS England in 2014, to over 1,200 today.
- 2.2.3 Python, R, and webdev tools (HTML, css, Ruby, PHP) are the most popular languages.

# Benefits to the NHS

- 3.1.1 As set out in the NHS Digital Service Manual, public services are built with public money–so unless there’s a good reason not to (security for example), all code produced by the NHS should be made publicly available.
- 3.1.2 Any open code can be reused by our developers to reduce costs, avoid duplication of effort, generally increase staff efficiency, make system changes more quickly and pursue the best approaches, not just those locally available. 
- 3.1.3 Others can learn from your experiences
- 3.1.4 Others find uses for your code which you had not found
- 3.1.5 Publishing under open licences also drives up the quality of services we buy and promotes a more varied ecosystem of products and providers.
