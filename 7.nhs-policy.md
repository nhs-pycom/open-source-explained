When publishing your code you need to make sure:

- you’re clear about who owns the code and how others can use it
- you do not release information that should remain closed
- you store it in a repository managed by your department
- any third-party tools you use to host or manage your code follow the National Cyber Security Centre’s cloud security guidance
