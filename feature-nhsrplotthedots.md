# NHSRplotthedots

This package is built by the NHS-R community to provide tools for drawing a specific type of statistical process control (SPC) chart, the XmR chart. This includeds the use change points, and to apply rules with summary indicators for when rules are breached.

This package supports the NHSE/I programme ‘Making Data Count’ programme. The programme encourages boards, managers, and analyst teams to present data in ways that show change over time, and drive better understanding of indicators than ‘RAG’ (red, amber, green) rated board reports often present.
