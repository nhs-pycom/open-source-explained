# [Communities of Practice](https://github.com/nhs-pycom/open-source-explained/blob/main/6.communities-of-practice.md)

Communities of practice have been set up to bring together teams across government who share common job roles, responsibilities or remits, but otherwise are working in departmental/organisational silos. Their aims are to foster communication, interaction, and provide opportunities to share knowledge, ideas and experience. 

## NHS-R
 
The NHS-R community supports the learning, application and exploitation of R in the health and care system in the United Kingdom through a community of people by providing  training alongside a friendly space on slack for sharing, discussing and developing solutions to NHS and care sector problems using the amazing expertise of our community and the amazing data science capabilities of R.

R is a powerful, free open-source data science and statistics environment, used in industry, academia and major corporations (eg Microsoft, Google, Facebook) but its use in the NHS is less prominent. The absence of R at scale in the NHS, means that the NHS is unable to take advantage of the huge benefits of R including a worldwide R community which freely shares learning and resources. Likewise, the NHS-R Community also shares its learning and resources freely.

Membership to the NHS-R Community is open to all subject to a code of conduct. However, our events are prioritised  or restricted to people who work in the public sector in the United Kingdom.

## NHS Python Community

Lead by enthusiasts and advocates, the NHS Python Community for Healthcare is an open community of practice that champions the use of the python programming language and open code in the NHS and healthcare sector. Python is an open source, state of the art programming language, used by developers, data scientists, and data engineers. Python's widespread adoption is, in part, due to its accessible 'human readable' syntax, making it relatively easy to pick up and learn. Along with other open source analytics tools such as R, Python will be essential to drive the 21st century digital transformation of health care.

#### Principles and aims of the Python Community 
- Promote the use of python in the healthcare by celebrating success and recognising contributions across the community
- Reduce barriers to entry by highlighting best practice with regard to software, IT operations, security, and coding in the open
- Open source and publish code to public GitHub repositories under appropriate licences (such as MIT, OGLv3, and GPLv3) alongside suitable open datasets or synthetic data so that our work can be further developed, re-used, and improved upon by everyone in the community
- Break down silos of expertise and improve technical communication and collaboration across the NHS, health and social care sectors
- Champion diversity, inclusion, and representation in tech by making coding accessible to all members of the community regardless of background or current level of ability 

The NHS Python Community for Healthcare is open to anyone interested in championing the use of Python, programming, and open code in the NHS and healthcare sector.
