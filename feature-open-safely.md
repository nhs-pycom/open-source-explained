# OpenSAFELY

OpenSAFELY is a secure, transparent, open-source software platform for analysis of electronic health records data. All platform activity is publicly logged. All code for data management and analysis is shared, under open licenses and by default, for scientific review and efficient re-use.

OpenSAFELY is a set of best practices encoded as software. It can be deployed to create a Trusted Research Environment (TRE) alongside appropriate database, compute, governance, and administrative elements; or it can be deployed as a privacy-enhancing layer on any existing secure database or TRE.

## Open Working, Open Sharing

OpenSAFELY has been created, with public and charitable funding, for the benefit of population health. All underlying code for the platform is open-source: it can be viewed, evaluated, and re-used freely by all. All analysis code that executes on the platform must also be shared for review and re-use under an Open Source Initiative approved license, with the MIT license being the default.

This is in keeping with best practices, including those set out in the Bennett Institute Open Manifesto: researchers should share their methods and code so that other teams can review their work, learn from it, and re-use it; researchers should feel safe and confident about publishing pragmatic, imperfect, working code; people developing code for tools and services should ideally work in public from early on in the project where possible.

Using OpenSAFELY is a collaborative process. All users are able to review, evaluate and re-use the codelists, code, libraries, documentation and other open resources produced by users who have worked in OpenSAFELY before them. In turn, all users contribute to the development and expansion of the platform as they deliver their own work: for example by contributing to codelists, documentation, user-research, research papers, code libraries, lay summaries, or blogs.
