# NHS App

### The NHS App enables people to:

- get health advice using the health A-Z on the NHS website
- find out what to do when they need help urgently using NHS 111 online
- register as an organ donor
- choose whether the NHS uses their data for research and planning
- show others the details of their COVID-19 vaccine (or vaccines) when travelling abroad

### Patients can register and prove who they are so they can:

- order their repeat prescriptions and view, set or change their nominated pharmacy, where they want their prescriptions to be sent
- view their GP health record securely
- manage their first hospital or clinic appointment with a specialist, when they are referred by their GP, through the NHS e-Referral Service (e-RS)

### In some GP practices, depending on which systems are in use, people can also:

- message their GP surgery, doctor or health professional online
- consult a GP or health professional through an online form and get a reply
- access health services on behalf of someone they care for
- view useful links their doctor or health professional has shared with them

All GP practices in England are connected to the NHS App. This means that anyone aged 13 or over and registered with a GP practice in England can use it.
